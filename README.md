-My software dev philosophies are:
  
    90s-2000s Software Philosophy - Buy once, own forever, no subscriptions
    Offline-First - Works 100% without internet, ever
    Local Data Ownership - Files stay on user's machine, standard formats
    Simple Distribution - One .exe or folder to copy
    User Control - No telemetry, no phoning home, no data collection
    Performance Focused - Fast on 2012 hardware, instant on modern
    Multi-Language Development - Using each language for its strengths
    Privacy-First - No tracking, no analytics, no accounts required
